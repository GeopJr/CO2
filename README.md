## How does CO2 (the action) work?

CO2 (the action) will calculate your website's carbon emissions based on the amount of data it transfers to the client, as well as notify you if your host is using renewable or bog standard energy, along with how much CO2 you could not emit by switching to one that uses renewable energy (if not on one already).
Some fun (or not so fun) facts about it in the long run will also be included!

To stay on par with [Website Carbon Calculator](https://websitecarbon.com/) without spamming their API, the same functions happen locally.
This includes their [calculations](https://gitlab.com/wholegrain/carbon-api-2-0) as well as their way of getting the amount transferred data (lighthouse).

The renewable energy data is provided by the [The Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/), however since it relies on an external API, it is disabled by default.

Lastly, the action will:

- print the results on the action log
- comment on the commit that caused the push event to be emitted
- comment on the PR that caused a pull_request event to be emitted

The action uses a prebuilt Docker image based on node:lts-slim with chromium and pnpm. You can find it on [Dockerfile.base](./Dockerfile.base). During building, [Dockerfile.base.dockerignore](./Dockerfile.base.dockerignore) replaces [.dockerignore](./.dockerignore).

#

## Installation

A basic workflow would be:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/CO2.yaml
name: Calculate CO2 üå±
# You can remove any you don't want
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Calculate CO2 üå±
        uses: GeopJr/CO2@v1
        with:
          url: "https://geopjr.dev/"
          renewable: true
```

## Combinations

You can combine actions and create cases for more control, here's some:

<details><summary>Conditional based on event</summary>

```yaml

      - name: Calculate CO2 üå± on push
        if: github.event_name == 'push'
        uses: GeopJr/CO2@v1
        with:
          url: "https://gnome.org/"
          renewable: true

      - name: Calculate CO2 üå± on PR
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'

## Credits

This whole action is heavily inspired by the [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/) by [Wholegrain Digital](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/).

The renewable energy check is being done by [The Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/).

Both of them support a great cause so consider supporting them:

- https://www.wholegraindigital.com/#services
- https://nlnet.nl/donating/ (I'm not sure how to donate to The Green Web Foundation, but this it the closest I could find)

Take action: [Switch to a green host](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/choose-a-green-web-host/) | [Make your website more efficient](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-efficiency/) | [Plant trees to reduce your carbon impact](https://treesforlife.org.uk/support/for-businesses/carbon-offsetting/)
